  "Engineering Frosh is a themed, student-organized event hosted annually for the incoming engineering class and this year we present: The Legend of Frosh. Each new student will have their first chance to explore the mystical world of Montreal while simultaneously being introduced to the epic engineering community. Led in large groups by upper-years, our participants (froshies) get a chance to bond with other quest-goers in their faculty while adventuring around the city to classic student-friendly sites, restaurants, and more. Through our individual and all-faculty events each participant will experience a range of fantastic activities from a tough, team-building defence-oriented design competition to an all-out, magical toga party. No matter your interests, the coordinators, leaders, and staff involved are here to welcome you and are excited to give you your first taste of the legendary McGill student life.";
