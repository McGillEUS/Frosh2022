"Engineering Frosh is a themed, student-organized event hosted annually for the incoming engineering class. This year we present: Cloudy with a Chance of Frosh. Each new student will have their first chance to enter the beautiful world of Montreal while simultaneously being introduced to the epic engineering community. Led in large groups by upper-years, our participants (froshies) get a chance to bond with other froshies in their faculty while adventuring around the city to classic student-friendly sites, restaurants, and more. Through our individual and all-faculty events, each participant will experience a range of fantastic activities from a tough, team-building design competition to an all-out, magical, concert-style party. No matter your interests, the coordinators, leaders, and staff involved are here to welcome you and are excited to give you your first taste of the legendary McGill student life.";
